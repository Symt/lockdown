## The End


It seems that this project will be finished for the foreseeable future. It was a fun project while it lasted. With Brandon out of high school and me (Charlie) losing interest in continuing, it is time to close this off. I still believe this could be used and built upon to be an approvement of Mosyle Manager, which still has many flaws.
